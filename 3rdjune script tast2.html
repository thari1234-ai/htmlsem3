        <h1>Welcome to Tharini Travel Page</h1>
        <p>Unlike the usual dream destinations filled with beaches or mountains, my heart is drawn to a place where silence speaks louder than words â€“ a cremation ground. My travel destination is not just about sightseeing; it's about soul-seeing. I want to visit a place where life and death meet, where traditions burn brighter than the flames themselves. A place like Varanasi, where the eternal fire at Manikarnika Ghat has never stopped burning, reminds us of how temporary yet meaningful life is. I don't seek joy in luxuries, but in understanding the truth of existence. In the thick smoke and chants of mantras, I want to feel the weight of time, the peace after pain, and the beauty of letting go. It's not a sad journey â€“ it's a powerful one. A travel to the very edge of life... and maybe beyond..</p>
